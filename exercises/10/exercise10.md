### Penetration Testing

In this exercise, you will learn how to do penetration testing on a simulated website.  You will play the part of a white-hat hacker trying to break into a website.

Go to this site: https://www.hackthissite.org/

Make an account and complete as many of the "Basic Missions" that you can.  You must complete up to Mission 8 (i.e. mission 8 must be completed) for full credit.  If you complete all of them, you may move on to "Realistic Missions" or whichever other missions you find interesting.

If you do not complete this in class, you may email me a screenshot _by the beginning of the next class_ of your highest completed Mission for credit.

### Grading

```
Completed Mission 4: 0.5 points
Completed Mission 6: 1 points
Completed Mission 8 or higher: 2 points
