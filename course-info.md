**Recommended Texts:** 

_Test-Driven Development: By Example_, Kent Beck ISBN-13: 978-0321146533

I have both of these texts available for you to borrow.

This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern software testing and quality assurance. Although it will cover testing theory, the emphasis is on providing practical skills in software testing currently used in industry. To that end, it will cover: manual and automated tests, test-driven development, performance testing, and understanding and developing a testing strategy.

## Grading

* Projects (80%):
  * Deliverable 1 - 10%
  * Deliverable 2 - 20%
  * Deliverable 3 - 10%
  * Deliverable 4 - 15%
  * Deliverable 5 - 10%
  * Deliverable 6 - 15%
* Exercises (20%):
  * Includes numerous in-class exercises and lectures
  * See below

Although you are not required to come to every class, it is strongly recommended that you do.  Attendance _will_ be taken for days with class exercises, and this will count for your class participation.  These days are listed on the syllabus as EX_n_ (where _n_ is in the range {1,10}).

The following grading scale will be used.  

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100.00-94.00 | A (A+ for extraordinary work)
93.99-91.00  | A-
90.99-88.00  | B+
87.99-84.00  | B
83.99-81.00  | B-
80.99-78.00  | C+
77.99-74.00  | C
73.99-71.00  | C-
70.99-68.00  | D+
67.99-64.00  | D
63.99-61.00  | D-
60.99-0.00   | F

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group projects, and students to do entirely their own work on the other projects.  Projects may be analyzed with the Stanford _moss_ system to detect unauthorized collaboration between groups or individuals.  Any student caught collaborating or cheating will automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that exam, and may be penalized more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.

Assignments should be committed and pushed to GitHub to _a private repository_ and shared with the TA and me by the beginning of class on the due date.  Write-ups are due at the beginning of class and must be given to me in person.  Late assignments will not be accepted absent of extraordinary circumstances.

Please ensure that you have a student GitHub account so that you can make private repositories.  This is free and available here: https://education.github.com/

If any disputes from groups arise, I will assume that GitHub is the "ground truth".  For example, if Partner A insists that they did all the work, but GitHub history shows only commits by Partner B, I will assume that Partner B has done all the work.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies in grading.

## Attendance

Lecture attendance for non-exercise classes is not required, but is STRONGLY recommended. The instructor will try to ensure that all information on the exams and projects will be available via slides, but simply reading them may be insufficient to understand the concepts thoroughly.   Presence for exercise days is required in order to get the full class participation score.  These will not be rescheduled individually.

There are no midterms or other exams for the summer session.

## Project Details

The semester, we will work mostly on one large application, and it will progress throughout the course of the term.  This will allow you to see how an application can improve through time with proper qulity assurance procedures.

* **Deliverable 1:** A test plan and traceability matrix for a system.
* **Deliverable 2:** Development of an application using test-driven development.
* **Deliverable 3:** Automated system-level tests.
* **Deliverable 4:** Performance testing and improvement of an application.
* **Deliverable 5:** Improving a system based on the results of static analysis.
* **Final Deliverable:** An analysis and test strategy for a large application.

Deliverables must be handed in by the beginning of class on the day that it is due.  Late deliverables will NOT be accepted except in the case of an emergency.

## Programming Language Selection

For all deliverables, the class will use Java 1.8 or later with the appropriate frameworks (e.g., git, JUnit, Mockito, Selenium, FindBugs, checkstyle) as discussed in class.  Projects written in other languages or using alternative frameworks will generally not be accepted.

## Participating in Class

Under reasonable circumstances, it is almost always better to participate in class than not.  Questions and comments are invited and strongly encouraged!  However, this implies raising your hand and waiting to be called upon.  In dire circumstances, some waving of the hands in order to get the instructor's attention is allowed, but suboptimal.  Talking out of turn or while the instructor is speaking is generally frowned upon.  If it persists after a warning has been given, the instructor may ask any offending parties to leave the room to continue their discussion elsewhere.

## Disability Services Statement

"The Office of Disability Resources and Services (DRS) provides a broad range of support services to assist students with disabilities. Services include, but are not limited to, tape-recorded textbooks, sign language interpreters, adaptive and transportation. Contact DRS at 412-648-7890 or 412-383-1355 (TTY) in 216 William Pitt Union or see www.drs.pitt.edu for more computer technology, Braille translation, and nonstandard exam arrangements, DRS can also assist students with accessibility to campus housing information."

## Academic Integrity Statement

"As members of the University of Pittsburgh community, A&S students are expected to meet the obligation to exhibit honesty and to respect the ethical standards of the University community and of their chosen field of study in carrying out academic assignments. A&S students are therefore expected to familiarize themselves with the published rules and regulations go to http://www.fcas.pitt.edu/academicintegrity.html
